# Simple DDOS TOOL
The Website Load Testing Tool is a Python-based script that allows you to evaluate the performance and resilience of a website by simulating high volumes of traffic. This repository provides the necessary code and instructions to help you get started.

## Features

- **Load Testing**: Simulate a large number of concurrent requests to your website to assess its performance under heavy traffic conditions.
- **Performance Metrics**: Measure key performance metrics such as response time, throughput, and error rates to gain insights into your website's performance under different loads.
- **Customizable Testing Parameters**: Configure the number of concurrent requests, testing duration, and other parameters to suit your specific load testing requirements.
- **Detailed Reporting**: Generate comprehensive reports with performance metrics and visualizations to analyze the results of the load testing and identify areas for improvement.
- **Ethical Use**: Ensure you have proper permission from the website owner before performing load testing to avoid any legal or ethical issues.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to get started with the Website Load Testing Tool:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Begin by cloning this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/kabir403/flood.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the cloned repository and install the necessary dependencies by running the following command:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```


3. **Run the Test**: Execute the load testing script by running the following command:

   ```
   python ura.py
   ```

5. **Analyze Results**: Once the load testing is complete, the tool will generate a detailed report containing performance metrics and visualizations. Use this information to evaluate your website's performance under different load scenarios.

6. **Iterate and Improve**: Based on the insights gained from the load testing, make necessary optimizations to your website and repeat the testing process to gauge the impact of the changes.
